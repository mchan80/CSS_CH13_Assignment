        Hi! I'm Megan. I am currently a full-time student studying UX design.
        During my free time, I enjoy learning Chinese, watching K-dramas,
        thrifting, and listening to various genres of music. I also really like
        traveling, swimming, rock climbing, and trying all sorts of food.
      </p>

        I'm really enjoying this web development class so far. I am having fun
        discovering the technical aspects of coding and look forward to
        exploring more of the design aspects as I continue to learn about CSS.
